# Whatdoing

## Description
Whatdoing is a progress tracker that keeps all your hobbies—like books, games, and shows—in one place.

This project is currently in two parts:
 - This repo is the server.
 - See the client [here](https://github.com/JustinLi007/whatdoing-cli)

## Motivation
I couldn’t find an efficient way to track my progress across various hobbies. Physical lists and digital notes became disorganized and tedious to update, with repetitive copying and pasting. I needed a streamlined solution to keep everything clear and manageable. With Whatdoing, I can consolidate all my lists in one place and provide a simple way to manage and navigate them.

## Quick Start
The project is ongoing, and I look forward to sharing more updates and features soon.
